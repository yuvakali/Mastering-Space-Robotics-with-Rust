# SpaceSensor Temperature Converter

Welcome to the **SpaceSensor Temperature Converter** project! This project is part of the "Mastering Space Robotics with Rust" course, specifically in **Week 1: Core Rust Foundation**. It demonstrates the use of Rust for building a temperature conversion utility for space sensor data.

## Features

- Convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
- Simple and efficient implementation using Rust.
- Designed for high precision and reliability in space applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust installed on your system. You can download it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yuvakali/Mastering-Space-Robotics-with-Rust.git
    cd Mastering-Space-Robotics-with-Rust/Week1_Core_Rust_Foundation/spacesensor_temperature_converter
    ```

2. Build the project:
    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```

3. Run the tests:
    ```bash
    cargo test
    ```

### Usage

Run the program with:
```bash
cargo run
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to input temperature values and select the desired conversion.
