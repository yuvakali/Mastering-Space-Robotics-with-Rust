## Overview

Mission Control is a Rust-based application that simulates the management of space missions. It provides tools to monitor spacecraft, schedule tasks, and handle mission-critical operations. This project emphasizes safe and efficient programming practices using Rust.

## Features

- **Task Scheduling**: Plan and manage mission-critical tasks.
- **Spacecraft Monitoring**: Track spacecraft status and telemetry.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management for mission safety.
- **Concurrency**: Leverage Rust's concurrency model for efficient operations.

## Getting Started
