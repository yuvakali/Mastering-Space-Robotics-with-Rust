# Mission Calculator

Welcome to the **Mission Calculator** project! This tool is designed to assist in performing essential calculations for space robotics missions, leveraging the power and safety of the Rust programming language.

## Project Structure

This project is part of the **Mastering Space Robotics with Rust** course and is located in the `Week1_Core_Rust_Foundation` module.

## Features

- Perform mission-critical calculations with precision.
- Built with Rust for performance and reliability.
- Modular and extensible design for future enhancements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version). Install it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yuvakali/Mastering-Space-Robotics-with-Rust.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Mastering-Space-Robotics-with-Rust/Week1_Core_Rust_Foundation/mission_calculator
    ```
3. Build the project:
    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```

### Usage

Run the calculator with:
```bash
cargo run
```

### calculation type:
1. Orbital Velocity
