# 🚀 Mastering Space Robotics with Rust

### A 5-Week Roadmap to Embedded Excellence

Welcome to your one-stop roadmap for becoming proficient in **space robotics and embedded systems development using Rust**. This guide blends theoretical understanding with real-world, hands-on projects—building your skills from the ground up.

---

## 📅 Roadmap Overview

This learning plan spans **5 weeks**, structured around daily tasks and progressively complex projects in:

- 🦀 **Core Rust Programming**
- 🤖 **Embedded Development (no_std)**
- ⚙️ **Motor Control & Real-Time Systems**
- 🧠 **Control Algorithms (PID, Filtering, Kalman)**
- 🌐 **ROS2 Integration**
- 🛰️ **Distributed Systems & Telemetry**

---

## 🧪 Weekly Highlights

### **Week 1: Core Rust Foundation**
- CLI tools for mission control
- Geometry library for satellite systems
- Weather station with API & logging

### **Week 2: Embedded Rust & Microcontrollers**
- LED control, GPIO interrupts
- I2C sensor integration
- Real-time telemetry streaming

### **Week 3: Control Algorithms & Motor Drivers**
- PID tuning and motor feedback
- Encoder integration
- Closed-loop trajectory control

### **Week 4: ROS2 + Rust + Real-Time Messaging**
- ROS2 publisher/subscriber in Rust
- Serial bridge for embedded communication
- Simulated rover control with Gazebo

### **Week 5: Networking & Distributed Systems**
- TCP, MQTT, WebSocket servers
- IoT cloud integration
- Mesh sensor network coordination
### 🔧 **SpaceRobotics Mission Simulator**
